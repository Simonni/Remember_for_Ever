            <h3>ABOUT</h3>
            <h5>…Time to Remember … </h5> <br/>
            The idea for the memorial website was first conceived when I decided to re-create the life story of my grandparents. My grandfather served in the military with his brothers during World War II. He passed away when I was a child, so I have only vague memories of him. My grandmother faced great hardships raising my dad and his two siblings in impoverished post-war Russia. I have tender memories of her that I will cherish forever.
